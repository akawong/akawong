- 👋 Hi, I’m Jorge Wong, a BIM architect taking his first programming steps.
- 👀 I’m interested in Architecture, music, social dancing, economy and finances, politics, and many other fields. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and Python by building projects and understanding how they work. I already took some tutorials that taught me the language basics.
By building projectsI´ll certainly learn a lot more.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that may involve BIM software (mostly autodesk software as I mainly use those tools on a daily Basis).
- 📫 Reach out to me through Linkedin
